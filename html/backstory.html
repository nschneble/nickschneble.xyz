		<h1>Who is Nick Schneble?</h1>
		<p>It all started with Cal Ripken Jr.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>My first great love was the bacon cheeseburger from TGI Fridays in the early 2000s. Sum 41's <em>Fat Lip</em> playing on the radio. A pair of American Eagle "distressed" boot cut jeans—bought with my employee discount—torn at the bottoms as they dragged beneath my shoes.</p>
		<img src="/images/frosted-tips.jpg" alt="A well-aged photo of myself in 2001 with frosted tips">
		<p>I lived a life in Atlanta. A degree from Georgia Tech. The Philly cheesesteak sandwich from Waffle House after cheap beer at Sidelines. Frosted tips.</p>
		<p>I lived another life in LA. Late night stops at In-N-Out. Sunny weekend drives on the PCH. A complete dissociation of the seasons.</p>
		<p>In my late twenties and thirties, I went global and spent over a decade traveling as a digital nomad. I <a href="https://7in7.co/">co-founded a conference</a> with the goal of visiting all the continents. We made it to five before the pandemic dropped.</p>
		<p>Most recently, I've been blessed with late-discovered neurodivergence. Some rather successful antidepressants. A newfound love of mapmaking, pottery, and plant-based cooking. An appreciation of the North Shore of Massachusetts.</p>
		<p>I can't wait to see how Dungeon Crawler Carl ends. When Haunted Chocolatier launches and I spend hours in my shop. I might also move to Scotland.</p>

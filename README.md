# This is my _perfect_ motherf*cking website.

It's _exactly_ as f*cking perfect as [this guy's website](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/).

## Yes, this is partially f*cking satire

The creators of [this](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), [that](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/), and [the other](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/) site did a great job making simple, functional, high-performing, and accessible websites that are easy to read and aren't completely f*cking atrocious, for the most part.
